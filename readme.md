# Reading Go compiler code

Writing code is easy. Reading is hard.

I tried reading Go compiler before, and I gave up.
But the compiler is written in Go language now, so maybe the code
is readable this time.

I create this repository and will try to convert the code into small
files that have no circular dependencies, so that it can be plotted
like (this)[http://8k.lonnie.io]. I will refactor the code *a lot*,
so there is no hope the changes can be merged into the official repo.
This is only my own try to understand the code, once more.

Let's see how far I can go.
