# Reading Go compiler code

Writing code is easy. Reading is hard.

I tried reading Go compiler before. It was hard to read, and I gave up.
The compiler is written in Go language now, so maybe it
is readable? I want to give it another try.

I create this repository and will try to convert the Go compiler code into 
small files (no more than 300 lines each) 
that have no circular dependencies, so that it can be plotted
like (this)[http://8k.lonnie.io]. I will refactor the code *a lot*,
so it is unlikely the changes can be merged into the official repo.
This is only my own try to understand the code, once more.

Let's see how far I can go...
